gen_vtable_funcs.py - structural vtable / code-pointer-table scanner (EXIT 1).

Lifted verbatim from the SCIV reference (sciv/scripts/gen_vtable_funcs.py) and
re-pointed to EXIT 1's image layout. Every safety filter is preserved unchanged;
only the per-game constants (exec range, import-thunk range, scan regions,
basefile path, file names) differ. See the SCIV/MSXX history for the full
rationale; the short version:

ReXGlue's built-in vtable discovery (src/codegen/vtable_scanner.cpp) is gated on
MSVC RTTI Complete Object Locators. EXIT game code is compiled with RTTI
effectively disabled for game classes, so that scanner finds essentially no
vtables. Every function reachable *only* through a vtable slot (adjustor thunks,
no-op `blr` virtuals, ordinary virtual methods, E_NOTIMPL stubs) is therefore
never discovered or registered, and the first indirect call to one traps at
runtime with "Call to invalid or unregistered function at guest address 0x...".

This script recovers those entry points structurally, without RTTI:
  * scan .rdata and the file-backed part of .data for 4-byte big-endian values
    that are valid, 4-aligned pointers into the executable range;
  * group them into maximal runs of consecutive code-pointers (a vtable / fnptr
    table is exactly such a run);
  * within runs of length >= MIN_RUN whose targets span >= MIN_SPREAD bytes,
    accept a slot target T only if the instruction at T-4 is an *unconditional*
    function terminator (blr / bctr / unconditional b/ba / zero padding) -- i.e.
    T begins right after a previous function ends. That single check makes T a
    genuine function entry and rules out mid-function false positives that would
    otherwise create overlapping functions and break codegen.

Output is a TOML file of size-less `[functions]` entries (codegen auto-discovers
each extent). Entries already present in exit1_config.toml / exit1_fixups.toml
are skipped so their explicit size hints / hand-authored boundaries are preserved.

EXIT 1 layout (from default.basefile.exe PE section table, base 0x82000000):
  .rdata 0x82000400-0x820331AC   .text 0x82040000-0x821F33D4 (only exec section)
  .data  0x82200000-0x8254DE9C (vsz), file-backed first 0x63800 (->0x82263800)
  import thunks: 165 x 16B at the tail of .text, 0x821F2984-0x821F33D4.
Unlike SCIV there is no second executable section (no "PSFD00"); .text is the
whole exec range, and the thunk table runs exactly to the end of .text.

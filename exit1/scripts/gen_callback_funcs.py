gen_callback_funcs.py - immediate-constructed code-pointer (callback) scanner (EXIT 1).

Lifted verbatim from the SCIV reference (sciv/scripts/gen_callback_funcs.py) and
re-pointed to EXIT 1's image layout. Every safety filter (interior-range,
switch-base, continuation/funclet, import-thunk) is preserved unchanged; only the
per-game constants differ.

Two scanners already recover function entry points for this RTTI-disabled game:
  * ReXGlue's call-graph discovery finds anything reached by a direct `bl`.
  * scripts/gen_vtable_funcs.py recovers entries reached through a *pointer table*
    in .rdata/.data (vtables / fnptr tables).

Neither catches a function whose address is **materialised in code** by a
`lis`/`addi` (or `lis`/`ori`) pair and then passed by register to a callee that
calls it indirectly (`bctrl`). This is the classic "callback / comparator passed
by pointer" shape -- e.g. a compare function handed to a sort/search routine.
There is no static pointer to it anywhere in the image (so the vtable scanner
sees nothing) and nothing ever `bl`s it (so call-graph discovery sees nothing),
so it is never registered. The first indirect call to one traps at runtime with
"Call to invalid or unregistered function at guest address 0x...".

This script recovers those entries structurally:
  * scan the executable range for `lis rD,HI` immediately followed (small window,
    same base register) by `addi rDST,rD,LO` or `ori rDST,rD,LO`;
  * compute the constructed address T = HI<<16 + signext(LO)  (addi)
                                   or  T = (HI<<16) | LO       (ori);
  * accept T only if it is a 4-aligned pointer into the executable range AND the
    instruction at T-4 is an unconditional function terminator (blr/bctr/uncond
    b/ba/zero pad) -- i.e. T begins right after a function ends, which makes it a
    genuine entry and rules out mid-function false positives (the same guard the
    vtable scanner uses), and is neither a switch-table case base nor an internal
    continuation / EH funclet.

Output is a TOML file of size-less `[functions]` entries (codegen auto-sizes
each). Entries already present in exit1_config.toml / exit1_fixups.toml /
exit1_vtables.toml are skipped so their hints / prior recovery are preserved and
no duplicate keys are emitted.

EXIT 1 layout: exec range = .text only 0x82040000-0x821F33D4 (no second exec
section); import thunks 0x821F2984-0x821F33D4 at the .text tail. See
gen_vtable_funcs.py for the section-table derivation.

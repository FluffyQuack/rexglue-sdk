// exit_common - shared, game-agnostic ReXGlue glue
//
// Host timer-resolution fix for frame pacing.
//
// 360 titles throttle their main loop with guest timed waits
// (KeWaitForSingleObject with a timeout / KeDelayExecutionThread), which the SDK
// lowers onto Win32 Sleep / WaitForSingleObjectEx with millisecond timeouts.
// Those honour the *system timer resolution*, which defaults to the scheduler
// quantum (~15.6 ms). A ~16.6 ms one-frame wait can then overshoot to the next
// ~15.6 ms boundary, randomly landing at ~31 ms -- so the game advances less
// often than once per displayed frame (jitter, slowdown). Raising the resolution
// to 1 ms (timeBeginPeriod) tightens those waits so they land within ~1 ms of the
// requested interval. This was the exact MSXX slowdown fix; whether a given
// title's pacing needs it is confirmed during bring-up, but 1 ms resolution is a
// safe default.
//
// Project-side glue only -- no SDK fork. Windows-only (matches the build).
